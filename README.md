# Dotfiles

I Mainly use this when im on a diffrent device and not on my main PC.
But if you want to use them as an example or something its completely fine


## Neovim

Standard Neovim config i try to keep this updated but sometimes i may forget

## Powershell

I Have diffrent themes so that why the `themes` folder exists (The `WTThemes` Folder contains the the terminal theme i use not oh my posh themes)

## Install.ps1
This file basically contains all of the stuff i use on windows on a daily basis i made it so whenever i reinstall binbows i can just run one file and install all of the stuff i need
