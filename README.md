# Dotfiles

I Mainly use this when im on a diffrent device and not on my main PC.
But if you want to use them as an example or something its completely fine

- [x] Neovim
- [x] Windows Terminal
- [x] VSCode

## Neovim

Standard Neovim config i try to keep this updated but sometimes i may forget

## Powershell

I Have diffrent themes so that why the `themes` folder exists (The `WTThemes` Folder contains the the terminal theme i use not oh my posh themes)
